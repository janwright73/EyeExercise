# Eye Exercise
Eye exercise for CSS experience.  Two eyes are placed on the screen and the eyeballs follow the mouse movements.

<img src= "oneeye.png" width='300'/>


This project demonstrates the following concepts: 
- Practice with CSS attributes
- organizing project files by type


I had fun with this project that teaches a programmer how to use CSS attributes such as width, height,background,display,margin,border-radius,position, and overflow.


### How to Run
Anyone can run this file by downloading the repository and loading the index.html file to a browser.


### Future Improvements
Add different eye shapes, and more eyes to the screen (for monster eyes simulations)!
